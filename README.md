# How they Work </br>

The Pickups are basically a voltage regulator circuit made of 2 resistors.  The resistors form an upside down V where the bottom two connections are the power and ground and the top (where the resistors meet) is the reduced voltage output.</br>

The output voltages below 1.0 volts are traps which can cause harm to the player who tries to use them or somehow incacitates the player.</br>

The output voltages between 1.0 and 2.0 volts are beneficial to the players health in that they will shield or give them faster healing abilities.</br>

The output voltages above 2.0 volts are offensive buffs which increase a weapons ability to do damage or give it faster recharge times.</br>
