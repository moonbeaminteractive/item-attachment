#Pickups
There are several different types of base enhancements afforded by the pickups. The five types are increased mana factor, increased healing factor, increased shields, increase damage, and a nuke. 

An increased mana factor allows the wand player to cast spells at a faster rate. An increased healing factor would allow all players to heal at a faster rate when they are close enough to their team's totems. Increased shileds provide all players with increased defenses. Increased damage would allow all players to increase their attack damage. The nuke is an atomic bomb that, when used, attacks all players of the opposite team in who are in the vicinity. 

#Belt
Each player recieves a belt with four pickup holders.

#Treasure Boxes and Keys
Treasure boxes, scattered through the playing field, will have other types of pickups inside them. These treasure boxes are magnetically locked and cannot be opened because all sides are flush and inline with each other. Keys, however, can open up the boxes as they are also embedded with magnets. 

#Gameplay
Before gameplay, each player selects up to four pickups to place in their belt. A couple treasure boxes will be placed in a central part of the playing field, while several keys are hidden in the playing field. Once gameplay starts, players can begin searching for the keys to open up the treasure boxes.
