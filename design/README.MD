There are several different types of base enhancements afforded by the pickups. The five types are increased mana factor, increased healing factor, increased shields, increase damage, and a nuke. 

An increased mana factor allows the wand player to cast spells at a faster rate. An increased healing factor would allow all players to heal at a faster rate when they are close enough to their team's totems. Increased shileds provide all players with increased defenses. Increased damage would allow all players to increase their attack damage. The nuke is an atomic bomb that, when used, attacks all players of the opposite team in who are in the vicinity.
